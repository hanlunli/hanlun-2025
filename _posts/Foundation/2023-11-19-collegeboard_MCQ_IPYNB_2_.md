# Review

# Questions

- Q5: each number in the list is equal to an incrementing constant, k, squared, then added to 3, so it would be [4, 7, 12, 19, 28, 39]

- Q8: the construtor doesn't work with string, string as the parameters, so I and II are right

- Q12: this code prints out every other letter, starting from the second letter

- Q23: The manipulate method iterates through a list of animal names in reverse, moving elements that start with "b" to specific positions. Key changes include moving "baboon" to index 1 and later to index 5, resulting in the final list: {"bear", "zebra", "bass", "cat", "koala", "baboon"}.
