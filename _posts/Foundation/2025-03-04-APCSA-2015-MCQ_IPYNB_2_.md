# MCQ Review: (Score: 35/39)

## MISSED QUESTIONS:

- Question 9: I chose option C because I forgot that (int) (Math.random() * 6) only generates a value from 0-5, not 1-6, making E the correct option.

- Question 22: I chose option B instead of A because I misread the for loop, and incorrectly thought it was using indices instead of being an enhanced for loop.

- Question 31: I misunderstood the loops in the question

- Question 33: I didnt choose option E is correct since  I didnt know that Integer.MIN_VALUE was acutally a valid way of representing the smallest integer value
