### Overview of Projects & Unique Contributions

In our class-wide project, we developed an integrated game platform that included a casino system with games, a banking backend, and persistent user financial data.

A unique challenge I tackled was integrating our banking schema with everyone's existing codebase. This involved reading, understanding, and modifying dozens of Java files, caefully resolving dependencies and ensuring data consistency across the project.

Another key innovation was in designing our analytics and profit map system. I had to determine the most efficient data types and structures for tracking and updating user profits/losses in real timeâ€”balancing performance with clarity in our SQL schema and JPA mappings.
