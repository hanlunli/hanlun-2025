    "![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mcq/q3.png)\n",
    "- Q5: each number in the list is equal to an incrementing constant, k, squared, then added to 3, so it would be [4, 7, 12, 19, 28, 39]\n",
    "![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mcq/q5.png)\n",
    "- Q8: the construtor doesn't work with string, string as the parameters, so I and II are right\n",

    "- Q12: this code prints out every other letter, starting from the second letter\n",

    "- Q15: III only checks the first and second elements, not the rest\n",
    "![image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mcq/q15.png)\n",
    "- Q23: The manipulate method iterates through a list of animal names in reverse, moving elements that start with \"b\" to specific positions. Key changes include moving \"baboon\" to index 1 and later to index 5, resulting in the final list: {\"bear\", \"zebra\", \"bass\", \"cat\", \"koala\", \"baboon\"}."
